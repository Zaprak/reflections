When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Every time you have to access your project files from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have non commited changes in your local repository that would be overwritten by a pull, since it would set your files to be equal to the ones on the remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are GitHub clones from and to their on servers, clones are copies of the repository in other servers or locally and branches are concurrent versions of the same repository. You fork someone else's project if you want to make chages that will most probably never be merged in the original one, you clone a repository to collaborate or simply work locally and you branch a repository to work on things that are not production ready.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It can be used to diff with the working directory to see changes since you were last online, for example

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Google Drive, Dropbox or, god forbid, e-mail could be used to send files and try to keep them up-to-date between two people. the overhead would be higher but easier to use with non tech people

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
