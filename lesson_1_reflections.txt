How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By filtering out unmodified code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Less time spent on debugging, since potential errors can only be added on changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually deciding a commit gives the user greater control on when to release, instead of sending a partial and maybe yet broken change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    More than one file can be affected by a single change, a function rename, for example, would need all files that reference it to be updated

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log show the commits so you can choose and compare them with diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can alter my code knowing I can simply reset a bad idea and without worrying it would stop the progress of the project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Android App Building
